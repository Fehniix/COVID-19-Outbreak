# COVID-19: Outbreak

A very simple SpriteKit project. The project aim was to build a game with auto-clicking and idle farming elements, featuring progression across "prestiging". This is a very early build and no unit tests were yet built; the project has been dismissed due to life being... life. The `TabController` might be refactored in the future, it was very fun implementing it and it's a pity SpriteKit does not provide many UI elements and controllers such as this one. :)
