The `MasterScene` contains the three scenes of the game: shop, research and virus scene.
The three scenes are all preloaded into memory, laying one along another, with one shown and the others hidden form the users.
This scene additionally handles UIPanGesture and UISwipeGesture, to switch between scenes and update the TabBarActiveItem.
